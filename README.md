# EWB-Game

Welcome! This is a repository for a video game that I created from scratch for Engineers Without Borders!

The purpose of this project is to create an interactive game for new Engineers Without Borders members to play after they are finished with the individual member training journeys. 

In the game, the user will use the arrow keys on their keyboard to control a sprite. This was implemented using event listeners. Throughout the game, the user will walk around the game board to open doors. The coding of the doors was implemented using a collision test function.
