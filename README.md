# EWB-Game

Welcome! This is a repository for a video game that I created from scratch for Engineers Without Borders!

The purpose of this project was to create an interactive game for new Engineers Without Borders members to play after they are finished with the individual member training journeys. 

This game was built using a combination of Javascript, HTML, and CSS. In the game, the user will use the arrow keys on their keyboard to control a sprite - they are going on a Venture.  This was implemented using event listeners. Throughout the game, the user will walk around the game board to open "Venture Doors". The coding of the doors was implemented using a collision test function. After the doors are triggered to open, an alert pops up on the user's screen, and a question form appears below the game. The user will then select the correct answer in the form and continue to open more doors if they have selected the correct answer! The question function was coded using the format of a form that checks whether the user entered the correct value. 

To play the game, clone this repository locally to your computer. Then you will be able to open a HTML port through your coding environment where the game can be played.
